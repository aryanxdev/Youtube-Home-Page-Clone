# Youtube-Home-Page-Clone

Cloned the home page layout of YouTube.com using pure HTML and CSS. 
I did this project while studying a course. 
This project helped me clean my hands with enough HTML and a good level of CSS.
I now have a good understanding of HTML tags, CSS selectors, GRID, FLEXBOX, POITIONS in CSS and other use CSS properties.
The course I followed : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&list=PLEPye7A7EcQZrT3VSBb7jtxnxIfY3yyG6&index=2
This is a really good course for any beginner out there, the way everything is explained and the exercises are the best to learn.
P.S. : I took help making the project from the course but my page is a bit different than the one in the course so do not snitch.
This is my first repository and I'm glad about it. THANKS.
